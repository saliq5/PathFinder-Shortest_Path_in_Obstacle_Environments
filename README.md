In this project, the primary objective is to implement multiple meta-heuristic approaches, namely Genetic Algorithms,
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and the A* (A-star)
algorithm, to address the challenges of both single-point
and multiple agent path planning in obstacle-rich environments. Our aim is to analyze the workings and advantages of
these meta-heuristic algorithms in the context of our specific
problem. By evaluating their performance and suitability, we
intend to determine the most effective approach for our desired
path-planning problem. Furthermore, for multi-agent path
planning, we plan to implement Conflict-Based Search (CBS), a specialized algorithm that focuses on resolving conflicts
and achieving efficient coordination among multiple agents in
dynamic environments. This addition will allow us to explore
the feasibility and effectiveness of CBS in solving the multiagent path planning problem. Through our implementation and
analysis of these various meta-heuristic approaches, we aim
to gain insights into their strengths, limitations, and potential
applications for solving path-planning problems in obstaclerich environments
